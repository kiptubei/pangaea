# Pangaea Notification and Subscription Service Part 1 of 2: The Back-end service
 For this challenge we'll be creating a HTTP notification system. A server (or set of servers) will keep track of topics and subscribers
where a topic is a string and a subscriber is an HTTP endpoint. When a message is published on a topic, it should be forwarded to all subscriber endpoints.

As part of the Pangaea subscription service we must create a back-end server application server from which topics will be published. This is part 1.

Please note that this repository only contains source code for the  back-end server application as depicted in the Architecture diagram below .For the push service and web client follow the link below.

Part 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/kiptubei/Pangaea-WebPush.git)

# Project Specification

For a detailed description of the assignement please refer to the ![task document](Pangaea_Take-home_assignment_Java_Backend.pdf)

# Project Architecture

![screenshot](webpush-architecture.png)

- The application is made up of the parts:
 * Web Client
 * Push Server [source](https://github.com/kiptubei/Pangaea-WebPush.git)
 * Api Server / Back-end 
 
- The web client will register a service work and get back subscription notification from our push service.

- The browser sends the subscription information to our back end. This information contains a public key, a secret, and the address of the push service.
- Our back end creates, encrypts, and sends push notifications to the push server.
- The browser needs to register a push event listener in the Service Worker code. This handler will receive push notifications even when the web application is
 not open
